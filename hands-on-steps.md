##1. Begining

1.1. Clone project
  
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/budabum/cucumber-java-skeleton 
  cd cucumber-java-skeleton
  mvn -e test
  ```
  
  Expect 1 scenario to be run, 1 step to pass and 2 to be pending.
  
1.2. Run idea
  
  1.2.1. Import project from maven

  1.2.2. Optional. Do it if Idea cucumber plugin has not been installed
  ```
  Settings -> Plugins -> Browse plugin repository and type cucumber in search.
  Install Cucumber for Java and agree to install dependant plugin.
  ```
  1.2.3. Run belly.feature file (should fail - has pending steps)

  1.2.4. Run RunCukesTest file (1 step passed and 2 ignored)
  
## 2. Evolution 1. Make test works

2.1. Copy autogenerated steps from cnsole into Stepdefs.java

2.2. Run

2.3. Add code to make test passed

2.4. Change something in test scenario to make it failed (this is important!)

## 3. Evolution 2. API testing

3.1. Get first version from git
  ```
  git checkout tag/step1
  ```
  
  3.1.1. If it does not work run *git checkout -- .*
  
3.2. Open file api_test.feature

3.3. Run it and then RunCukeTests

3.4. Insert features and tags to run only needed scenarios
  ```
  Replace
    @CucumberOptions(plugin = {"pretty"})
  with
    @CucumberOptions(plugin = {"pretty"}, features = {"src/test/resources/skeleton/api_test.feature"})
  
  Then add tag ‘@my’ to one of scenarios and into runner
    @CucumberOptions(plugin = {"pretty"}, features = {"src/test/resources/skeleton/api_test.feature"}, tags=”@my”)
  ```

3.5.  **TASK:** Create a couple more tests for one of these methods (see StringSteps)
          Use http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html as requirements
          
## 4. Running test server
  Go to https://github.com/budabum/eduke-server and follow instructions
  
  Run test server and keep it running.

## 5. Evolution 3. Rest testing.

5.1. Get new version from git
  ```
  git checkout tag/step3
  ```
  
5.2. Look at file rest_test.feature - you can run it or better run RunCukeTests

5.3. Let’s look at steps: RestSteps

5.4. **TASK:** Create one more test for route /plus
> http://localhost:9944/math/plus?a=2&b=3 - url spec for instance
5.5. *TASK:* Create one more test for route /divide
> http://localhost:9944/math/divide?a=9&b=3 -url spec for instance

## 6. Evolution 4. Rest testing continued.

6.1. Get new version
  ```
  git checkout tag/step4
  ```
  
6.2. Update maven dependencies in idea (if autoupdate is off)

6.3. Let’s install postman (plugin for chrome/chromium)

6.4. Run in postman
> GET http://localhost:9944/users 
<hr/>
> POST http://localhost:9944/users/add
>
> Content-Type: application/json
>
> {"email":"user11@email.com", "firstName":"autotest", "lastName":"user"}
<hr/>
> GET http://localhost:9944/users?email=user12@email.com 
<hr/>
> DELETE http://localhost:9944/users 

6.5. Look at file rest_test.feature - new scenario - get users with data table

6.6. Look at file RestSteps - it has changed.

6.7. **TASK:** create a couple more tests for *delete /users* and *post /users/add* routes

## 7. Evolution 5. Web testing

7.1. Get new version
  ```
  git checkout tag/step5
  ```
  
7.2. Update maven dependencies in dea (if autoupdate is off)

7.3. Look at file selenium_test.feature - run it (expected to fail)

7.4. Look at SeleniumSteps.

7.5. Uncomment lines 74,75 and comment 73.

7.6. Run test again - should pass

7.7. **TASK:** Create one more test for */web/adduser* page
